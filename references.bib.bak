	abstract = {Although graphite is known as one of the most 
				chemically inert materials, we have found that 
				graphene, a single atomic plane of graphite, can 
				react with atomic hydrogen, which transforms this 
				highly conductive zero-overlap semimetal into an 
				insulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals 
				that the obtained graphene derivative (graphane) is 
				crystalline and retains the hexagonal lattice, but 
				its period becomes markedly shorter than that of 
				graphene. The reaction with hydrogen is reversible, 
				so that the original metallic state, the lattice 
				spacing, and even the quantum Hall effect can be 
				restored by annealing. Our work illustrates the 
				concept of graphene as a robust atomic-scale 
				scaffold on the basis of which new two-dimensional 
				crystals with designed electronic and other 
				properties can be created by attaching other atoms 
				and molecules.},

  abstract={We present a new implementation of the cluster 
  			expansion formalism. The new code, UNiversal CLuster 
  			Expansion (UNCLE), consolidates recent advances in the 
  			methodology and leverages one new development in the 
  			formalism itself. As a core goal, the package reduces 
  			the need for user intervention, automating the method 
  			to reduce human error and judgment. The package extends 
  			standard cluster expansion formalism to the more 
  			complicated cases of ternary compounds, as well as 
  			surfaces, including adsorption and inequivalent sites.}
