The cells are defined by the periodic black lines in the drawings. The blue circles represent carbon atoms in the graphene lattice. Yellow and red circles represent hydrogen and calcium adatoms respectively. A thick border around an adatom signifies that the atom is below the plane.

We run the structures through atomic and electronic relaxation routines and use that data to create a predictive model for all possible structures. We then assign each structure a priority and choose a set of highest priority to run back through the loop.\relax }}{10}{figure.caption.7}
